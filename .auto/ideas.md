- 3-thread static-partition GEMV (OpenMP): rejected by memory wall (+4.2% slower, run #2). Revisit ONLY if per-token weight traffic drops substantially or on wider-bus hardware. Bit-identical design was proven (determinism held); patch lived in commit "rpi4: 3-thread OpenMP GEMV".
- Head-GEMV (336MB = 61% of per-token traffic) top-1 shortcut with exact recompute + error-bound candidate prefilter: needs rigorous max-miss bound proof before trying.
- Fuse elementwise passes into streaming kernels (attn scale into scores, G*=U into gelu, X+=H residual into rmsnorm write): saves small memory passes, bit-identical by construction.
- INVESTIGATED+REJECTED (data): exact-argmax head shortcut via Cauchy-Schwarz
  row-norm bounds. Survivor fraction median 100% (bounds far too loose;
  inner products cancel, norms don't discriminate). Min margin 0.04 logits
  also rules out any lossy prefilter. Killed by survey_bounds.py, 2026-10-05.
- WALL (proven): numpy streaming-sum ceiling on this Pi = 3.93 GB/s;
  driver moves 536MB/token at 3.84 GB/s = 98% of ceiling. No identical-math
  implementation can go below ~136ms/token here. Loop converged 2026-10-05.
- Prior OMP (+4.2%) and prefetch (+19%) discards were measured cross-session
  under drift; magnitudes unreliable but directions stand (bus-bound theory +
  dual-locality failure). Retry only with same-job A/B if wall assumption changes.
