- 3-thread static-partition GEMV (OpenMP): rejected by memory wall (+4.2% slower, run #2). Revisit ONLY if per-token weight traffic drops substantially or on wider-bus hardware. Bit-identical design was proven (determinism held); patch lived in commit "rpi4: 3-thread OpenMP GEMV".
- Head-GEMV (336MB = 61% of per-token traffic) top-1 shortcut with exact recompute + error-bound candidate prefilter: needs rigorous max-miss bound proof before trying.
- Fuse elementwise passes: DONE (run #4, C-port era; kept, bits identical). Pruned 2026-10-06.
- INVESTIGATED+REJECTED (data): exact-argmax head shortcut via Cauchy-Schwarz
  row-norm bounds. Survivor fraction median 100% (bounds far too loose;
  inner products cancel, norms don't discriminate). Min margin 0.04 logits
  also rules out any lossy prefilter. Killed by survey_bounds.py, 2026-10-05.
- WALL (proven): numpy streaming-sum ceiling on this Pi = 3.93 GB/s;
  driver moves 536MB/token at 3.84 GB/s = 98% of ceiling. No identical-math
  implementation can go below ~136ms/token here. Loop converged 2026-10-05.
- Prior OMP (+4.2%) and prefetch (+19%) discards were measured cross-session
  under drift; magnitudes unreliable but directions stand (bus-bound theory +
  dual-locality failure). Retry only with same-job A/B if wall assumption changes.
- DONE 2026-10-06: HF-exact gate is now real. Root cause of every "model is
  bad" verdict was ONE asm line (`mov w0, #2` = layer 0's q_norm for all 18
  layers in fwd_token). Lesson: a pos-0 / layer-0 check cannot see q_norm at
  all (softmax over one key) - always verify with tools/fwd_ref.py over a
  multi-token sequence and diff every layer x position.
- Reference-tool trap (cost a whole session): numpy/torch refs must scale the
  embedding by sqrt(640) AND apply post_attention_layernorm to the attention
  output before the residual add. Wrong refs produced a phantom "MLP bug"
  (engine GG 184.6 vs "HF" 12.2; the true HF value is 184.6). Fixed in
  l0_full/mlp_slot/slot_brute/gg_id/gg_w/gelu_id/l0_ref.
- Working oracle: tools/fwd_ref.py (fp64, prints `DX L<i> p<p>` per-layer
  residuals + top-5 logits) reproduces transformers exactly; pair it with
  tools/perlayer_probe.patch (`patch -p0 < ...`, rebuild) to localize any
  future divergence to a layer+position in ONE run. Both are how the q_norm
  bug was found.
- MIGRATION RECIPE (2026-10-06, 270m -> 1B): the expensive part is not the maths
  but the 270m constants hiding in the forward path. Parameterized now: HID,
  INTER, NLAY, VOC, the FL entry stride, every rmsnorm n / gemv M,K / gelu n /
  argmax n, the embed scale sqrt(HID), and full attention = `i mod 6 == 5`
  (HF's default when config.json has no layer_types). Traps found the hard way:
  tab[] must hold 2+13*layers slots (236 was 270m-only), and the embed gather
  and rmsnorm_add take their length as an argument - both were literal 640.
  Always grep for the literal immediately before a call, not only in the index
  arithmetic.
- 1B numbers (Pi 4, 3 cores): 543 ms/token = 1.8 tok/s, 2.00 GB weights per
  token => ~3.7 GB/s, i.e. the same 3.93 GB/s wall as 270m. 1B is the first
  checkpoint here that answers multi-item prompts correctly (3 colors, lists,
  one-sentence explanations); 270m tops out at one-line facts.
- PARITY TOOLING that works: tools/fwd_ref.py (fp64, any checkpoint via
  FWD_MODEL), tools/l0_any.py (layer-0 only, fits any size), tools/hf_greedy.py
  (manual loop; HF_DTYPE=bfloat16 because 1B fp32 exceeds the Pi's 3.8 GB), and
  tools/perlayer_probe.patch to dump per-layer residuals from the asm.
- Next candidates: gemma-3-4b (hidden 2560, 34 layers, inter 10240) needs bigger
  bss and will not fit 3.8 GB in fp32 for the HF check; consider int8 weights
  or a 2-bit path only if the bus wall ever stops binding.
